## Available pipelines

Pipelines are a core concept of wercker. They take code as input, execute a
series of steps, and produce a container. 

The steps used change according to the type of pipeline. Right now, wercker
distinguishes between three pipelines: **dev**, **build** and **deploy**.

### <a name="dev" class="anchor"></a>Dev

The goal of the development pipeline is to allow you to develop your
application locally inside of containers, while wercker takes care of
automating your development environment. You can specify
[services](/learn/containers/services.html), that will run inside containers,
which you need to run your app. Services can be Databases, Messaging queues, or
even your own specific API that you have hosted on Dockerhub. 

Developing inside containers and letting wercker automate that process, is
extremely useful because it allows you to execute your applications as they
would run on production (in a container!). That means that you get real
close to dev/prod parity. 

---
The dev pipeline is unique and in contrary to the build and deploy pipeline,
can only be used while using the wercker CLI, and not on the hosted wercker
platform.

In order to use the the development pipeline, incorporate the following in your
`wercker.yml` file.

```yaml
dev:
  steps:
    - npm-install
    - internal/watch:
        code: node app.js
        reload: true
```

### <a name="build" class="anchor"></a>Build

The goal of the build pipeline is to get your application ready for deployment.
This could mean compiling your app, running tests, linting and running
integration tests with other services. While the build pipeline also produces a
container, itâ€™s useful to extract only the artifacts that you need for the
actual deployment of your application by copying them to the
`$WERCKER_OUTPUT_DIR`.

```yaml
# Example build pipeline

build:
    steps:
        # Execute the bundle install step, a step provided by wercker
        - bundle-install
        # Execute a custom script step.
        - script:
            name: middleman build
            code: bundle exec middleman build --verbose
```

Two types of [steps](/learn/steps/introduction.html) are defined in this build
section. First a `bundle-install` step that installs the Rubygem dependencies.
This step is available from the [step
registry](/learn/steps/step-registry.html). The second step in an inline script
that in this case compiles our static site.

### <a name="deploy" class="anchor"></a>Deploy

Running a deploy happens in a fresh container and works the same as a build
pipeline. The only difference is that a deploy pipeline has access to the
results of a build pipeline, so that it can copy the needed artifact produced
by the build into this new deploy container. 

This container can then contain additional steps to either push the container
as-is to a registry (e.g. Docker Hub) and/or execute an API call to a
scheduler (such as [Kubernetes](/quickstarts/deployment/kubernetes.html) or
[Mesosphere](/quickstarts/deployment/mesosphere.html)) to notify that there is a
new version of a container image ready to be scheduled.

```yaml
# wercker.yml
(...)
deploy:
  steps:
    - internal/docker-push:
        username: $USERNAME
        password: $PASSWORD
        tag: my-amazing-tag
        cmd: my-amazing-command
        ports: "5000"
        repository: turing/bar
        registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com
```

In this example, we see that our container is being deployed to DockerHub.  To
do this, we use one of [internal](/docs/steps/internal-steps.html) - steps that
are baked into the [wercker CLI](http://wercker.com/cli).  Environment
variables are used to hold the correct credentials. The values of these
environment variables are specified through the [wercker web
interface](/learn/basics/configuration.html). Alternatively, you can export
these variables in your local [ENVIRONMENT](/learn/basics/configuration.html)
file. 

> The container will be pushed to DockerHub as-is. So be mindful of which things
you actually include in your container!

We've covered a lot of ground on this page but fortunately there are dedicated
sections for topics such as [pipelines](/learn/pipelines/introduction.html),
[containers](/learn/containers/introduction.html) and
[steps](/learn/steps/introduction.html).
