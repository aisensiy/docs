## Workflows

*Workflows support the creation of complex, container-centric developer workflows.*

Workflows provide you with a mechanism to manage your [pipelines](/docs/pipelines/index.html).
With Workflows, you can create **any type of pipeline**, and more importantly **chain them
together**. 

Workflows can only be defined in the UI and consists of a name, 
a [hook type](/docs/workflows/managing.html) and a [pipeline name](/docs/pipelines/index.html), 
which is defined in your [wercker.yml](/docs/wercker-yml/index.html).

Read more about creating Workflows [here](/docs/workflows/managing.html).

### Example Workflows

#### Build, push and release
