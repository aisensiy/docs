## Docs

Welcome to the wercker documentation! The *docs* section covers all the Wercker
concepts and common tasks. If you are completely new to wercker, it's
recommended to first go through the [learn
section](http://devcenter.wercker.com/learn/basics/introduction.html).

The most important sections are [workflows](/docs/workflows/index.html),
[pipelines](/docs/pipelines/index.html) and
[wercker.yml](/docs/wercker-yml/index.html), each topic a building block of the
Wercker product.
